Hi. I am a full stack software developer specializing in MERN stack. Since the moment I was exposed to programming, it was all I ever wanted to do. I have always had a passion for problem solving, but thought my love of logic puzzles would be something I would only ever do as a hobby. Software development has given me an avenue to not only do what I love, but also to engage me and challenge me to always improve my skills.

I earned a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from Rutgers University. Before starting the program I took it upon myself to learn as much as I could, even developing a real time chat application using React, Node, Express, Knex, Postgres, and socket.io. In my time working through the program, I was able to hone my skills as a React developer, learn the importance of folder structure, and learn new technologies like GraphQL. One of my most important experiences was collaborating with other developers throughout the program, and in some instances, using my many years of supervisory experience to help lead the team to complete the project effectively and efficiently.

My love of problem solving, my drive to always improve, and my strong collaborative skills make me an advantageous candidate for any team.
